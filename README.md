# Skipper Analysis

A set of analysis tools written mainly in Python for analyzing data taken using skipper CCDs. Note: this tool is under very active development, use at your own risk.

### Prerequisites

* Python (either 2.7 or 3 should work)
* Numpy (for efficient handling of data arrays)
* Astropy (for loading data from .fits files)
* Scipy (for low-pass filtering)

# Recommended

* Matplotlib >=2.1.1(for plotting, not necessary otherwise, any version that includes SymLogNorm should work)
* pyds9 for displaying images from python in DS9
